# 🪙 Cryptocurrency Dashboard

The **Cryptocurrency Dashboard** is a front-end web application built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Bootstrap**. It fetches real-time cryptocurrency data from the **CoinPaprika API**, allowing users to explore up-to-date cryptocurrency information like prices, symbols, rankings, and more.

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/visualGravitySense/crypto-data)

## 📚 Technologies

- **React** — A JavaScript library for building user interfaces and managing component states.
- **Vite** — A modern front-end build tool for fast development and build processes.
- **Bootstrap** — A CSS framework for building responsive and styled web applications.
- **CoinPaprika API** — A public API used to fetch current cryptocurrency data, including prices, symbols, and rankings.

## 📈 Key Features

- **List of Cryptocurrencies**: Displays a comprehensive list of cryptocurrencies with sortable columns (e.g., by symbol, name, rank).

## 🛠 Project Structure

The application follows a component-based architecture, making it modular and easy to extend.

```
/src
  /components     # Reusable React components (e.g., CoinList, CoinDetail)
  /pages          # Application pages (e.g., Home, CoinDetailPage)
  /styles         # SCSS files for component-specific styling
  /api            # API helper functions for fetching data
```

Key Files:
- `App.jsx` — Main application file that contains routing and theme management.
- `CoinList.jsx` — Displays a table of cryptocurrencies with sorting and search functionality.
- `CoinDetailPage.jsx` — Displays detailed data for a specific coin.
- `api.js` — Contains functions to interact with the CoinPaprika API.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

- **Homepage**: 
  - Displays a searchable and sortable list of cryptocurrencies.
  - Search by symbol or name.
  - Sort by cryptocurrency rank, symbol, or name.
  
- **Coin Detail Page**: 
  - Click on any cryptocurrency to view detailed information, including price, rank, market cap, and more.

## 🔄 Future Plans

- **Price Visualization**: Add charts to display historical price changes for each cryptocurrency.
- **Dark Mode**: Implement dark mode for a better user experience in low-light environments.
- **Expanded Coin Details**: Show more information such as trading volume, supply, and price change trends.

## 🛠 Development Workflow

1. **Branching**: When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, always create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add search functionality to cryptocurrency list"
   ```

3. **Pull Requests**: After completing your feature, push your branch and open a pull request on GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/add-new-feature
   ```

### Notes

1. **Screenshots**: Add project screenshots in the relevant section to visually represent your application.
2. **API Key**: If your API requires a key, provide instructions for configuring it. In this case, CoinPaprika does not require one, but if you add APIs requiring keys, explain the setup.
3. **Future Plans**: Regularly update the "Future Plans" section to reflect ongoing and planned improvements.

By following this structure, your README will remain professional, clear, and useful for both users and developers!
